# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Jump to Entity (Ctrl+click in editor)** — Ctrl+click (or Cmd+click on Mac) any entity ID in the YAML editor to instantly see a floating popup with the entity's current state, friendly name, domain, icon, and key attributes. A "Copy ID" button lets you copy the entity ID to the clipboard. The popup dismisses on outside click or Escape. No backend call needed — entity data is sourced from the already-loaded autocomplete registry.

- **HA Config Check Runner** — A new `fact_check` toolbar button (and "Check HA Configuration" command palette entry) runs the Home Assistant configuration validator directly from the editor. The backend tries `hass --script check_config` first, falling back to `ha core check` on HAOS. Results appear in a floating bottom-right panel showing pass/fail status and a list of errors with file:line references. Clicking a file reference opens the file in the editor and scrolls to the offending line. The raw checker output is also available under a collapsible "Raw output" section.

## [2.4.2] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- **HA Service Autocomplete in Editor (3-A)** — The CodeMirror editor now offers live service name completions when typing on an `action:` or `service:` YAML key. All registered Home Assistant services are loaded at startup via a new `get_services` backend endpoint (backed by `hass.services.async_services()`). Results are cached for 30 seconds. When the cursor is on an `action:`/`service:` line, pressing `Ctrl+Space` or typing shows a dropdown of matching `domain.service` entries with their descriptions. Service lines are excluded from entity autocomplete to avoid mixed results.

- **Git Branch Management UI (3-B)** — A full branch manager is now available in both the Git and Gitea panels. Click the `account_tree` icon in either panel header (or the branch chip next to the panel title) to open it. From there you can: list all local branches with their remote tracking status, switch (checkout) any local branch, create a new branch from current HEAD, merge any branch into the current branch, and delete local branches (with unmerged-commit safety check and force-delete fallback). All branch operations are wired to new backend endpoints (`git_checkout_branch`, `git_create_branch`, `git_delete_local_branch`, `git_merge_branch`).

- **Conflict Resolution UI (3-C)** — When a merge or pull results in conflicts, both the Git and Gitea panels now show a "Merge Conflicts" section with per-file "Ours / Theirs" buttons instead of just a generic "Abort" button. Clicking "Ours" accepts the local version; "Theirs" accepts the incoming version. After resolving, stage and commit as normal. The "Abort & Reset Sync" button is still present to discard the merge entirely. Two new backend endpoints support this: `git_resolve_conflict` (wraps `git checkout --ours/--theirs` + `git add`) and `git_get_conflict_files` (wraps `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U`). Conflict files are fetched from the backend during every status refresh and stored in `gitState.conflictFiles` / `giteaState.conflictFiles`, replacing a broken heuristic that intersected unstaged and modified file lists.

- **Admin-only gate for destructive actions** — Deleting files, force-pushing, hard-resetting, deleting remote branches, and restarting Home Assistant now require the requesting user to be a Home Assistant administrator. Non-admin users receive a 403 response instead of being able to perform these operations.

- **File-watch cache invalidation** — The file tree cache is now invalidated immediately when Home Assistant fires a `folder_watcher` event (requires the [folder_watcher integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/folder_watcher/)). Previously the cache could remain stale for up to 30 seconds after an external file change. The 30-second TTL fallback remains in place when the integration is not configured.

- **HA state response cache** — `get_entities`, `get_areas`, and `get_devices` now use a 5-second in-memory cache. Repeat calls within that window (e.g. opening multiple panels in quick succession) are served instantly without re-iterating the HA state machine. Filtered entity requests (AI autocomplete, entity pickers) always bypass the cache to return fresh results.

- **Deferred startup git check** — The git status check on integration load is now deferred via `hass.async_create_task`. All views are registered immediately and Blueprint Studio no longer adds to Home Assistant startup time.

- **Keyboard shortcuts: Terminal, Git panel, Format YAML (4-D)** — Three new keyboard shortcuts added: `Ctrl+`` toggles the terminal panel (maps to the existing `toggleTerminal` function), `Ctrl+Shift+G` collapses/expands the Git panel, and `Shift+Alt+F` formats/indents the current YAML file. All three are documented in the keyboard shortcuts overlay (F1). The `Ctrl+Shift+G` shortcut fires a new `git:toggle-panel` event handled by `GitCoordinator`.

- **Testing suite (4-E)** — Added `tests/test_ai_nlp.py` (80 tests) and `tests/test_ai_validators.py` (40 tests). The NLP tests cover all 7 extraction functions: `detect_domain`, `extract_area`, `extract_values` (12 domains), `detect_trigger_type` (13 trigger types), `extract_conditions` (11 condition types), `detect_additional_actions`, `extract_automation_name`, and `find_multi_domain_entities`. The validator tests cover `_detect_file_type`, `_detect_yaml_variant`, `_validate_entity_id`, `check_yaml`, `check_json`, `check_python`, and `check_blueprint`. All 120 tests pass on Python 3.14 without a Home Assistant install (HA and aiohttp are stubbed). Run with `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v`.

### Fixed

- **Git/Gitea panel collapse state not restored after refresh** — Collapsing the GitHub or Gitea changes panel and then refreshing the page caused the panel to reappear expanded. The root cause was a crash in `gitStatus`/`giteaStatus`: the new conflict detection code introduced in this version called `.toLowerCase()` on `gitState.status`/`giteaState.status` without guarding against non-string values returned by the API. The crash prevented `git:refresh` from being emitted, so `updateGitPanel`/`updateGiteaPanel` never ran and the saved `gitPanelCollapsed`/`giteaPanelCollapsed` state was never applied. Fixed by guarding both calls with `typeof ... === "string"` checks, consistent with the existing guards in `git-ui.js` and `gitea-ui.js`.

- **Collapsible file tree state not persisted across refresh** — In collapsible tree mode, collapsing a folder and refreshing the page caused it to reopen. `toggleFolder` updated `state.expandedFolders` but never called `saveSettings()`, so the change was lost on reload. Fixed by calling `saveSettings()` on both collapse and expand in `toggleFolder`.

- **File search and content search in explorer broken** — Filename search and content (text) search in the file explorer stopped working. Two separate bugs caused this: (1) `fetchWithAuth` spread array JSON responses into plain objects (`{ ...result, status }`) which destroyed the array structure needed by `list_files` and `global_search` — fixed by returning arrays directly without spreading; (2) The streaming content search sent the auth token via `window.pwaAuth?.getToken?.()`, which is only available in PWA standalone mode and always returns `""` in the Home Assistant iframe context — fixed by using `getAuthToken()` from `api.js`, which correctly handles both HA iframe and PWA authentication.

- **Global sidebar search showing only entities, no file results** — Searching in the sidebar global search panel returned entity matches but no file content matches. The root cause was the same `fetchWithAuth` array-spreading bug (#1 above) combined with a fallback path that silently returned an empty array when the POST-based search failed. Fixed by switching `performGlobalSearch` to use the same authenticated NDJSON stream endpoint (`search_stream`) as the explorer content search, which already worked correctly. A POST-based fallback is retained for environments where streaming is unavailable.

- **Global sidebar search: incremental streaming results** — File matches in the global search sidebar now appear incrementally as each file is scanned, matching the behaviour of the explorer content search. Results are patched into the DOM as they arrive (new file groups are appended, existing groups receive new matches) rather than waiting for the full scan to finish and re-rendering. Collapsed file groups stay collapsed during streaming and the list does not flicker.

- **Sidebar toggle broken after device rotation** — On iPad Pro 13 (and other tablets near the 1024px width boundary), rotating to portrait mode caused the sidebar toggle to stop working. The show/hide functions used `isMobile()` to decide which CSS class to apply (`visible` vs `hidden`), but `isMobile()` returns different values in portrait vs landscape. After rotating, the sidebar could end up with the wrong class for the active breakpoint, making the toggle appear to have no effect. The fix removes the `isMobile()` branch — both classes are now always applied consistently on every show/hide call, so orientation changes cannot leave the sidebar in a mixed state.

- **Large text file guard** — Opening a text file larger than 10 MB in the editor now returns a clear error message instead of attempting to load the full content. The frontend's existing warning dialog continues to handle the 2–10 MB range, allowing the user to open or download at their discretion. Binary files (images, video, PDF) are unaffected — they continue to be served via the binary path with no size restriction.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed

- **Git panel: file selection not registering on checkbox click** — Clicking directly on a checkbox in the Git changes panel did not register the selection, causing a "No files selected" toast when attempting to stage. The click handler correctly skipped the checkbox element itself, but no `change` event listener existed to catch direct checkbox interactions. A `change` listener has been added to mirror the same pattern already working in the Gitea panel.

- **Git panel: push/pull sync buttons non-functional** — After committing, the green `arrow_upward` and orange `arrow_downward` indicator buttons in the panel actions bar did nothing when clicked. The buttons were created dynamically on each panel refresh without any event listener attached. Event delegation has been added to the git panel to handle clicks on `btn-git-push-sync` and `btn-git-pull-sync`. Additionally, the `git.js` code path was missing the `id` attributes on these buttons entirely, preventing the delegation from matching them.

- **Gitea panel: push/pull sync buttons non-functional** — The same issue affected the Gitea changes panel. The dynamically created `btn-gitea-push-sync` and `btn-gitea-pull-sync` buttons had no click handlers. Event delegation has been added to the Gitea panel to wire these buttons to `giteaPush` and `giteaPull` respectively.

- **Validator: automations with `use_blueprint:` incorrectly routed to blueprint checker** — Any automation file containing `use_blueprint:` triggered the blueprint validator instead of the standard YAML validator, because the file-type detector matched the substring `blueprint:` inside `use_blueprint:`. This caused a false "Blueprint must be a YAML mapping (dict)" error toast on valid automation files. The detection now uses a regex that only matches `blueprint:` as a standalone root-level key, not as part of `use_blueprint:`.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-20

### Blueprint Studio 2.4.0 — PWA Power, Blueprint Magic, SFTP & SSH Supercharged

### New Features

#### "Use Blueprint" Form — Instantiate Blueprints as Automations
- **Toolbar button**: `btn-use-blueprint` appears in the editor toolbar whenever the active file contains a `blueprint:` block
- **Command palette**: "Use Blueprint (Instantiate)" command added
- **Split-view panel**: The form opens in the secondary pane (side-by-side with the YAML editor) rather than a modal overlay — same pattern as Markdown Preview
- **Smart form controls** — selector type is mapped to an appropriate control:
  - `entity` / `target` → searchable dropdown with optional multi-select pill UI, filtered by domain
  - `device` / `area` → searchable dropdown populated from HA device/area registry
  - `boolean` → animated toggle switch
  - `number` → range slider synced with a numeric input box, respects `min`/`max`/`step`/`unit_of_measurement`
  - `select` (single) → `<select>` dropdown; `select` (multiple) → checkbox list
  - `time` / `date` → native time/date pickers
  - `duration` → H / M / S spinners
  - `template` / `action` / `condition` → resizable textarea with YAML/Jinja placeholder
  - `icon` → text input with `mdi:` placeholder
- **Section accordions**: Blueprint `input` groups render as collapsible `<details>` sections
- **Automation Name & Description fields** at the top of the form
- **Live YAML preview**: Generated automation YAML updates as the user fills in fields (600 ms debounce, API call to `instantiate_blueprint`)
- **Live editor→form sync**: While writing or editing a blueprint in the primary editor, the form re-parses and re-renders automatically after 1 second of idle time — filled values for unchanged inputs are preserved across re-renders
- **Save dialog**: choose to append to `automations.yaml` (auto-reloads HA automations) or write to a new file
- **Workspace persistence**: the form survives browser refresh — `blueprintFormActive` and `blueprintFormTabPath` are saved to settings and restored on load
- **Tab close behaviour**: clicking × on the secondary pane's tab closes the form and returns to single-pane view; the blueprint YAML file remains open and unmodified
- **Backend** (`api_misc.py`, `ai_generators.py`):
  - `parse_blueprint_inputs(content)` → structured JSON of sections, inputs, selectors, and defaults
  - `instantiate_blueprint(content, input_values, name, description)` → substitutes `!input` tags, returns ready-to-paste automation YAML with `alias` + `description` + UUID comment header
  - `get_devices` / `get_areas` — new GET actions using HA device/area registries (async-safe)

#### Blueprint Conversion — Smart Input Extraction ( Use ctrl+k/cmd+k and choose convert to blueprint) (`convert_automation_to_blueprint`)

- **Pass 1 (existing)**: Entity IDs → `entity` selector inputs with friendly `"The {domain} entity for this automation"` descriptions
- **Pass 2 — Numeric values**: Detects `above:`, `below:`, `temperature:`, `brightness:`, `brightness_pct:`, `position:`, `volume_level:`, `color_temp:`, `percentage:`, `humidity:` and extracts them as `number` selector inputs with appropriate `min`/`max`/`step`/`unit_of_measurement`. Values ≤ 1 without a decimal point (boolean-like) and template lines (`{{`) are skipped
- **Pass 3 — Delay/for durations**: Block-form (`delay:\n  seconds: 10`) and string-form (`delay: "00:05:00"`) delays and `for:` blocks are extracted as `number` (seconds) inputs with names `delay_seconds` / `duration_seconds`
- **Pass 4 — Time triggers**: `at: "19:00:00"` values are extracted as `time` selector inputs named `trigger_time` (incrementing suffix for multiples)
- **Pass 5 — Automation mode**: The `mode:` field (e.g. `single`, `queued`, `parallel`) is extracted as a `select` input named `automation_mode` with all four valid options
- **Pass 6 — Condition state values**: String values under `state:` keys in condition blocks are extracted as `text` inputs, skipping reserved values (`on`, `off`, `true`, `false`, `unknown`, `unavailable`)
- Collision-safe naming: duplicate keys get `_2`, `_3` suffixes
- `instantiate_blueprint()` now accepts and inserts a `description:` field into the generated automation
- Users can select a part of an automation file and then convert to blueprint

*   **File Existence Handling**: Fixed backend bugs related to directory creation and improved unzipping reliability for deep folder structures.

### Performance Improvements

#### Media Streaming & Large File Downloads
- **file_manager.py**: `serve_file()` now uses `web.FileResponse` for zero-copy serving with HTTP Range/206 support — required for `<video>` and `<audio>` seek
- **file_manager.py**: `download_folder()` / `download_multi()` stream ZIP archives via `web.StreamResponse` + `BytesIO` instead of buffering the entire archive in memory
- **api.py**: New `BlueprintStudioStreamView` at `/api/blueprint_studio/stream` — `requires_auth=False` with manual query-param token validation, dedicated to media streaming and folder downloads
- **sftp_manager.py**: `read_file_raw()` returns raw bytes; SFTP files are served via `StreamResponse` (no base64 overhead)
- **sftp.js**: `sftpStreamFile()` generates blob URLs for SFTP media playback
- **asset-preview.js**: Video/audio previews use streaming URLs (local files) or blob URLs (SFTP)

#### Multipart Upload — Bypass 16 MB Limit
- **api.py**: New `BlueprintStudioUploadView` at `/api/blueprint_studio/upload`
  - `requires_auth=True`; overrides HA's global 16 MB `client_max_size` via `request._client_max_size = 0`
  - Reads multipart form data in chunks — no base64, no memory spike
  - Handles both local (`_upload_local`) and SFTP (`_upload_sftp`) targets via a `connection` field
- **sftp_manager.py**: `create_file_raw()` writes raw bytes directly to SFTP (no base64 decode step)
- **downloads-uploads.js**: All binary uploads (local + SFTP) now route through `uploadFileMultipart()` / `uploadFileMultipartSftp()`; text files continue using the JSON POST path
### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Editor Indentation
*   **Format Code respects indentation setting**: Prettier's Format Code action now uses your configured tab size and indent-with-tabs preference instead of always formatting to 2 spaces.
*   **Settings panel stays in sync on file switch**: When opening a file with different indentation, the detected indent is now reflected in the Settings panel dropdown, not just the status bar.
*   **Status bar shows correct indent when no file is open**: The status bar placeholder now reflects your saved indentation setting (e.g. "Spaces: 4") instead of always showing "Spaces: 2".
*   **Added "Indent with Tabs" toggle to Settings panel**: The setting previously only accessible via the status bar picker is now also available in Settings → Editor, alongside the Tab Size dropdown.

#### SFTP Stale Expanded-Folder Paths Persisting Across Reloads
- **sftp.js**: `_refreshCurrentDir()` now emits `settings:save` after pruning stale expanded-folder entries, preventing them from being restored on next load
- **sftp_manager.py**: `list_directory()` catches `FileNotFoundError` and logs at DEBUG rather than ERROR

### Security Fixes

#### Fixed Command Injection in SSH Spawn
- **terminal_manager.py**: Escaped SSH command arguments using `shlex.quote()` to prevent shell metacharacter injection
  - Prevents attacks like `username=foo; rm -rf /` from executing arbitrary commands
  - Applied to host, username, and other user-controlled SSH parameters

#### Fixed `requires_auth = False` on Main API
- **api.py**: Changed `BlueprintStudioApiView` to `requires_auth = True`
  - Replaced custom authentication bypass with HA's native auth middleware
  - Leverages HA's built-in rate limiting and CSRF protection
  - Removes reliance on fragile custom Bearer token validation

#### Fixed Credentials Written to Disk in Plaintext
- **terminal_manager.py**:
  - Removed persistent plaintext SSH private key storage
  - Fixed Paramiko wrapper script that embedded credentials in source code
  - Implemented secure credential lifecycle (generated on-demand, cleaned up after use)
  - Private keys no longer left indefinitely on disk


#### SFTP Connection Pooling
- **sftp_manager.py**: Implemented connection pool with TTL-based cache
  - Keyed by `(host, port, username)` tuple
  - Connections reused for 60 seconds, then cleaned up
  - Eliminates redundant TCP+SSH handshakes per operation
  - Significant latency reduction for directory browsing and bulk operations

#### Remove Fake Filesystem Watcher
- **websocket.py**: Removed `async_watch_filesystem()` loop that fired redundant "poll" heartbeat every 10 seconds
  - The heartbeat was 100% redundant: real mutations already fire from `_fire_update()` in file_manager.py, and the frontend polls mtime independently every 10s
  - Removed `_async_start_watcher()`, `async_stop_watcher()`, and `async_start_watcher_callback()` functions
  - Removed unused imports: `asyncio`, `time`
- **\_\_init\_\_.py**:
  - Removed `async_stop_watcher` import and call in `async_unload_entry()`
- **settings-sync.js**:
  - Removed dead `startPollingForSettingsChanges()` function
  - Removed unused `POLLING_INTERVAL_MS` constant

#### WebSocket Reconnection for Long-Lived Sessions
- **api.js**: Enhanced `initWebSocketSubscription()` to handle HA WebSocket reconnections
  - Problem: Users idle 24+ hours would lose real-time updates when HA WebSocket dropped and reconnected
  - Solution: Extracted subscribe logic into `_subscribeToUpdates(conn, retries)` helper with module-level `_wsConn` guard
  - Registered `conn.addEventListener("ready", ...)` to auto-resubscribe on reconnect
  - Users can now continue editing seamlessly across network interruptions and extended idle periods

### Code Quality & Refactoring

#### Split Monolithic API View
- Extracted 822-line monolith into 5 domain-specific handler modules
  - **api_files.py**: File operations (list, read, write, upload, search, etc.)
  - **api_git.py**: Git/Gitea/GitHub handlers (45 functions)
  - **api_terminal.py**: Terminal WebSocket view + exec handlers
  - **api_sftp.py**: SFTP dispatcher with SFTP_ACTIONS frozenset
  - **api_misc.py**: Settings, AI, syntax checkers, utilities
  - **api.py**: Thin orchestrator (~190 lines) — class + dispatch tables only

#### Deduplicate Extensions, Allow Any Upload, Add Missing Editor Types
- **const.py**: Renamed `ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS` → `LISTED_EXTENSIONS` (controls visibility only, not access)
  - Added 25+ missing types: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.xml`, `.toml`, `.env`, `.sql`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.c`, `.java`, `.php`, `.lua`, and more
- **file_manager.py**: Removed allowlist gating from read/write/upload/search/replace operations
- **sftp_manager.py**: Deleted duplicate extension sets, imports from `const.py`
- **www/modules/**: Added editor modes, language names, icons for all new types

#### Split ai_manager.py into Domain Modules
- Split 2,320-line monolith into 5 focused modules
  - **ai_constants.py**: Lookup tables — domains, actions, error patterns
  - **ai_validators.py**: Syntax checkers — YAML, JSON, Python, JS, Jinja
  - **ai_nlp.py**: NLP extraction — domain detection, entity matching, triggers
  - **ai_generators.py**: YAML generation — automations, scripts, scenes
  - **ai_manager.py**: Thin orchestrator — AIManager class with query routing

*   **Advanced Domain Support**:
    *   **100+ Synonyms**: Maps terms like "chandelier" -> `light`, "roomba" -> `vacuum`, "deadbolt" -> `lock`.
    *   **Area Awareness**: Entity scoring algorithm boosts matches found in the mentioned room (e.g., "kitchen lights" prioritizes `light.kitchen_main`).

#### 📝 Jinja Template Support
*   **Advanced Editor**: Full syntax highlighting for `.jinja`, `.jinja2`, and `.j2` files.
*   **Distinct Syntax Coloring**: Brackets (`{{`, `{%`), keywords (`if`, `for`), variables, and operators are now colored distinctly from the surrounding YAML or text.
*   **Intelligent Validation**: dedicated validator checks for:
    *   Missing quotes in `states()` (e.g., `states(sensor.temp)` -> `states('sensor.temp')`).
    *   Wrong bracket usage (`{{{` -> `{{`).
    *   Missing filter pipes.
*   **Smart Suggestions**: Context-aware autocomplete for loops (`{% for %}`), time functions (`now()`), and state attributes.

#### 🎨 Professional UI Customization
*   **6 Theme Presets**: Dark (VS Code style), Light, High Contrast, Solarized (Dark/Light), Ocean, and Dracula.
*   **Custom Accent Colors**: 8 vibrant options (Blue, Purple, Pink, Cyan, etc.) with automatic hover color generation.
*   **Editor Personalization**: Adjustable font size (10-24px), 7 programming font families (Fira Code, JetBrains Mono, etc.), word wrap toggle, and whitespace visibility.
*   **File Tree Customization**: Compact mode for dense listings and toggleable file type icons.

#### 💾 Advanced File Management
*   **Configurable Auto-Save**: Automatically save files after typing stops (500ms - 5000ms delay).
*   **Smart Settings Interface**: New tabbed modal for General, Appearance, Editor, and Feature settings.
*   **Recent Files Limit**: Configurable history depth (5-30 files).
*   **Entity Explorer Mode**: New "Search Entities" toggle in Global Search (`Ctrl+Shift+F`) to browse the Home Assistant entity registry, view states, and one-click copy IDs into your configuration.
*   **UUID Generator**: Insert random UUIDs instantly with `Ctrl+Shift+U` or via the Command Palette.
*   **Filter by Content**: New toggle in the File Explorer sidebar allows filtering the file tree by content (e.g., entity IDs) instead of just filenames.
*   **Full Theme Selector**: The bottom toolbar theme menu now includes all presets (High Contrast, Solarized, Ocean, Dracula) for quick switching.
*   **Custom Editor Colors**: Added ability to customize font colors for **Line Numbers** and **Fold Arrows** (collapsible indicators) in the editor.

### 🚀 Improvements
*   **Editor UX**: Fold icons are now 40% larger and scale proportionally with your chosen font size for better visibility and easier clicking.
*   **Theme Synchronization**: The bottom toolbar theme selector is now fully synchronized with the main Settings presets, including correct icons and labels for all specific theme modes.
*   **Slider Visibility**: Improved the visual contrast of settings sliders by updating track colors to ensure they are visible across all light and dark themes.
*   **Global Search Performance**: Engineered a faster search engine that automatically excludes binary files (`.db`, `.sqlite`, `.zip`) and all hidden folders (starting with `.`), including `.storage` and `.git`.
*   **Dynamic CSS Architecture**: All themes and accent colors applied via CSS variables for instant preview without reloading.
*   **Robust Backend API**: New `check_yaml` and `check_jinja` endpoints provide instant feedback to the frontend.
*   **Self-Healing Git**: Sync recovery tools and automated branch mismatch migration.
*   **Entity Scoring Algorithm**: improved fuzzy matching logic considers friendly names, entity IDs, and area context for more accurate device selection.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
*   **Robust Auto-Save**: Hardened the auto-save feature with background timer cleanup and execution guards to ensure it strictly respects the toggle state and prevents accidental saves after being disabled.
*   **Real-time Color Updates**: Fixed an issue where changing custom line number or fold gutter colors required a page refresh to apply.
*   **Double Save**: Resolved a conflict between editor and global keyboard shortcuts that caused files to be saved twice (and two toast notifications) when pressing Ctrl+S.
*   **Git Toggle Robustness**: Ensured the Git Changes panel and all associated toolbar buttons are completely hidden when the GitHub integration is toggled off.
*   **Drag-and-Drop Reliability**: Fixed an issue where moving files via drag-and-drop triggered duplicate API calls due to event bubbling, resulting in "Invalid path or exists" error toasts despite successful moves.
*   **Zero External Dependencies**: Local mode now strictly keeps configuration 100% private.
*   **Recent Files Logic**: Fixed limit enforcement and persistent storage issues.
*   **Toast Layering**: Corrected an issue where toast notifications were hidden behind modals by moving them to the highest visual layer (z-index).
*   **Editor Font Stability**: Corrected font loading race conditions on editor initialization.
*   **YAML Analysis**: Fixed line/column reporting for complex nested structures.
